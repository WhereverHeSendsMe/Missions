        <h2>South Asia Mission Trip</h2>
        <p>
          I am so excited to share this letter with you and express how the Lord has been moving in my life.
          I am currently a senior at the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), and I am majoring in Graphic Design with a minor in illustration.
          With that being said, I am also heavily involved in my church Comunidad Cristiana Luz y Vida, where I serve on the worship team, translating team, and the kids' church.
          Freshman year of college I joined an organization on campus called the Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM).
          I have served on leadership there for four years and am currently the creative intern, and serve on the Freshmen Connection team as well as the worship and women's team!
          The BCM is an on campus ministry which strives to present the Gospel and who Jesus Christ is to students through intentional discipleship.
          Our goal is to provide community, and spiritual growth to our local campus.
          We are with you and for you.
          The BCM has helped me immensely in my walk with the Lord.
          Through discipleship, mentors, events, activities, trips, retreats etc, I have seen what it truly means to be on fire for the Lord, live radically for Jesus, and share the good news with the nations.
        </p>
        <p>
            This summer I was presented with the incredible opportunity alongside the International Mission Board (IMB)to go with a team to South Asia to advance the gospel for about two weeksin 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            We will be working with my home church along with a variety of churches coming and going to help us serve. 
            The ministries we are able to serve in two different countries will be helped in the areas of children’s ministry, evangelism, and discipleship. 
            There will be opportunities to participate in evangelistic events and ministry among refugees that are in the area. 
            There will be home visits, baptisms, gospel sharing, devotionals, local Church encouragement, Church planting, a children’s camp that we are continuing to grow from our last summer in Colombia which a locally run camp called Summit Camps and an OKC nonprofit, Faithworks of the Inner City, that will be leading along with whatever else He has in store. 
            I will be serving with three other college students for this month-long summer residency program for missions. 
            The Lord has combined all of my passions of travel, language, culture, and ministry to continue pursuing missions. 
            I know the Lord is calling me to go serve and use my abilities given through Him and am relying on Him for strength and wisdom for raising the financial support. 
            If you would like to hear stories of God working in missions, or have any questions, please reach out.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            As I have expressed my heart for this trip, I know that I would not be able to go without the spiritual and financial support of my community. 
            As you feel called, I will be blessed abundantly if you would consider me prayerfully and/or financially. 
            The total cost of the trip is $4,000 which I need to raise by May 2023.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I am also seeking prayer partners. 
            These people would be willing to pray for our group’s ministry, safety, health, the people of Colombia and Panam&aacute;, the people we will be ministering to and possibly sharing the gospel to for the first time, along with the Church’s other mission trips and much more. 
            However you decide to give, your gifts will be used to serve those in need. 
            I cannot thank you enough for being the people that I can trust to guide me along the way! I am thankful for you!
        </p>

            With much love and joy, <br>
