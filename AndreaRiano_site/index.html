        <h2>South Asia Mission Trip</h2>
        <p>
          I am so excited to share this letter with you and express how the Lord has been moving in my life.
          I am currently a senior at the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), and I am majoring in Graphic Design with a minor in illustration.
          With that being said, I am also heavily involved in my church Comunidad Cristiana Luz y Vida, where I serve on the worship team, translating team, and the kids' church.
          Freshman year of college I joined an organization on campus called the Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM).
          I have served on leadership there for four years and am currently the creative intern, and serve on the Freshmen Connection team as well as the worship and women's team!
          The BCM is an on campus ministry which strives to present the Gospel and who Jesus Christ is to students through intentional discipleship.
          Our goal is to provide community, and spiritual growth to our local campus.
          We are with you and for you.
          The BCM has helped me immensely in my walk with the Lord.
          Through discipleship, mentors, events, activities, trips, retreats etc, I have seen what it truly means to be on fire for the Lord, live radically for Jesus, and share the good news with the nations.

            This summer I was presented with the incredible opportunity alongside the International Mission Board (IMB)to go with a team to South Asia to advance the gospel for about two weeks in Dec-Jan.
            We will be partnering with local missionaries to fulfill the Great Commision of living on mission.
            This trip is going to cost around $4,000.
            The expense breakdown is our base trip cost of $950, plane tickets, visa, insurance, food costs, and other potential expenses I amay encounter. I will be making several payments throughout the semester, and my goal is to have the full amount by the end of November.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            With that, I want to invite and askfor your support, both for me and our team. Please consider us in your prayers (Philippians 4:6).
            Please pray for this: The harvest and the laborers on the field (Luke 10:2), for us to share and experience the nature and love of God (Ephesians 3:18), and to run the race well (1 Corinthians 9:24).
            Additionally, I would like to ask if you would consider supporting me financially. If you would like to give, you can mail any check or cas payments to my collection point, Comunidad Cristiana Luz y Vida at 1218 N. Rockwell Ave, Oklahoma City, OK, United States, Oklahoma 73127.
            You could also venmo me at Kiana Moreno Bernal.
            Please make checks payable to Comunidad Cristiana Luz y Vida and on all payments include my name Andrea Riano, for the memo.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            If you have any questions or thoughts, do not hesitate to contact me. 
            Thank you for your continued consideration and support you have given me through my life and this season. 
            I want to become a full time missionary post graduation and I am so excited to be taking my first step in reguards to this dream!     
        </p>
    
        <p>
            With much love and joy, <br>
            Andrea Carolina Riano-Moreno
