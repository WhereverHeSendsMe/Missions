        <p> 
            Hey friends!
        </p>

        <p> <!-- Before -->
            After not going to church for about 6 years, in 2021, the Lord sent someone to invite me to church.
            Honestly, I didn't have any expectations for spiritual change. I was living in the world and thought I was happy. 
            I was not aware of the brokenness of my own soul.
        </p>

        <p> 
            As some of you may know, the Lord has been opening doors in my life over this passed year that I wouldn't of even imagined. <br>
            <div id="HeAllowed">
            He has allowed me to serve at FaithWorks. <br>
            He has allowed me to serve at Summit Camps.<br>
            He has allowed me to serve at Falls Creek. <br>
            He has allowed me to serve at Cartagena Colombia 
            He has allowed me to serve His people every day. <br>
            </div>

        </p>
    
        <p> <!-- Be more specific as to what you will be doing at each place -->
            Now, it looks like the Lord has provided another opportunity for me to serve the nations and spread His word. 
            There will be a team of us going to Bujumbura and Gitega, Burundi Africa July 7th - 20th! 
            We will be sharing the gospel through a youth camp, training local leaders, visiting churches, and so much more. In all we do His name will be glorified. <br><br>

            God is putting everything in place and working out the details. <br><br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I kept this section farely short to make an easy read. Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more!
            Look around this website; I plan on updating it periodically with photos, journal entries, missions, and FaithWorks! <br>

            <h2>How can you help?</h2>
            <h3>Pray!</h3>

        <div class="list">
            Pray for:
            <li>The hearts of the people we encounter in Burundi.</li>
            <li>The hearts of our team. That we may be reflections of Him to those around us.</li>
            <li>Your own heart. If you do not have a personal relationship with Jesus, it starts with asking him into your heart.
            </li>
            <li>Holy Spirit to be our guide and for us to be obedient to His guidance.</li>
            <li>Safe travels and good health.</li>

            <br>
        </div>
         </p>

         <h3>Give!</h3>
        <p>
            If you can help financially, that would also be greatly appreciated! <br>
            I will need to raise about $3,300 and every dollar helps! <br>
            Please, please, please do not feel obligated to give if it may cause financial stress.<br>
            I have faith that the Lord will provide a way.
