        <p> 
            Hey friends! Thank you for taking the time to follow the link!
        </p>

        <p> <!-- Before -->
            After not going to church for about 6 years, in 2021, the Lord sent someone to invite me to church.
            Honestly, I didn't have any expectations for spiritual change. I was living in the world and thought I was happy. 
            I was not aware of the brokenness of my own soul.
        </p>

        <p> 
            As some of you may know, the Lord has been opening doors in my life over this passed year that I wouldn't of even imagined. <br>
            <div id="HeAllowed">
            He has allowed me to serve at FaithWorks. <br>
            He has allowed me to serve at Summit Camps.<br>
            He has allowed me to serve at Falls Creek. <br>
            He has allowed me to serve His people every day. <br>
            He has been opening doors and continues to do so.
            </div>

        </p>
    
        <p> <!-- Be more specific as to what you will be doing at each place -->
            Now, it looks like the Lord is opening an opportunity for me to serve the nations and spread His word. 
            I will be joing a team going to Puerto, Columbia June 15th – 23rd and Bujumbura and Gitega, Burundi Africa July 15th – 26th! 
            In both countries we will be sharing the gospel, working with children (God has been preparing me for this through FaithWorks), training local leaders, and much more.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            God is putting everything in place and working out the details. <br><br>
