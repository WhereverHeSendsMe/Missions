        <p> Hey! Thank you for taking the time to follow the link! </p>

        
        <p>Hey friends! <br> <br>
            I have a huge life update that I would like to share. As some of you may know, the Lord has been opening doors in my life over this past year that I would have never of imagined myself doing a little over a year ago. He has allowed me to serve at FaithWorks. 
            He has allowed me to serve at Summit Camps through Vintage and FaithWorks. He has allowed me to serve at Falls Creek through Trinity Baptist Yukon. He has allowed me to serve His people more every day. He has been opening doors and continues to do so. <br><br>
        
            Now, it looks like the Lord is opening an opportunity for me to serve the nations and spread His word. I will be a part of a team going to Puerto, Columbia June 15th – 23rd and Bujumbura and Gitega, Burundi Africa July 15th – 26th! 
            In both countries we will be sharing the gospel, working with children (God has been preparing me for this through FaithWorks), training local leaders, and much more. <br><br>
        
            God is putting everything in place and working out the details. <br><br>
            How can you help?<br><br>
            Pray! <br>
            </p>

        <div class="list">
            Pray for:
            <li>The hearts of Burundi and Colombia.</li>
            <li>The hearts of our team.</li>
            <li>Your own heart.</li>
            <li>Holy Spirit to be our guide and obedience to His guidance.</li>
            <li>Safe travels and good health</li>
        </div>

        <p>
            If you can help financially, that would also be greatly appreciated! <br>
            For both trips, I will need to raise about $6,000 and every dollar helps!
