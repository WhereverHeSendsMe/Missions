                <li>How was God revealed?</li> <br>
                There's a lot I could say about how God was revealed on this trip. To start, God worked in the hearts of 8 people as they relinquished control of their lives to Him!
                
                Christ was also glorified in the testimonies that were presented throughout our trip. There was a guy in my youth camp group who really connected with how I stepped away from the church It was until after spending time in the world, we both saw that there was nothing out there that could fill the Christ sized hole we had.

                <li>What did God teach me about me?</li> <br>
                God taught me a lot throughout my time in Colombia. I think one of the biggest lessons was to slow down. As we traveled from town to town, I'd stare out the window of our bus and notice people were outside enjoying one another's company.

                How ofter am I trying to go onto the next thing on my To-Do list and often overlook the people around me. Being in my mid twenties, I often think about what I "should" have in life right now, rather than appreciate the things God has gifted to me for the moment. 
                I shared this thought with my dad and he said, "I remember when you guys [my older brother and I] were younger I'd wake up to go work all day then come home at night to see you guys were asleep. Next thing I know you and David are all grown up and I wasn't around for it.
                What do I have left besides a restaurant and that doesn't mean much to me anymore."

                 I will be updating these periodically as I pray and unpackage more in the time to come. (Lord willing, James 4:15)
