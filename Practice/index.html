        <h2 style="text-align: center;"> I’m going to Colombia & Panama!</h2>
        <p>
            I hope this letter finds you well!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am in my Senior year at the University of Central Oklahoma, expecting to graduate December of 2023. 
            I am continuing on the UCO campuses BCM (Baptist Collegiate Ministries) Leadership Team and have been going on local missions and continuing to share the gospel with the passions the Lord places on my heart. 
            I am so excited to share with you an opportunity that the Lord has given me. 
            After praying over several opportunities, I am called to serve as a summer resident June 8- July 14 in Colombia and Panamá with Go In The Name Missions.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will be working with my home church along with a variety of churches coming and going to help us serve. 
            The ministries we are able to serve in two different countries will be helped in the areas of children’s ministry, evangelism, and discipleship. 
            There will be opportunities to participate in evangelistic events and ministry among refugees that are in the area. 
            There will be home visits, baptisms, gospel sharing, devotionals, local Church encouragement, Church planting, a children’s camp that we are continuing to grow from our last summer in Colombia which a locally run camp called Summit Camps and an OKC nonprofit, Faithworks of the Inner City, that will be leading along with whatever else He has in store. 
            I will be serving with three other college students for this month-long summer residency program for missions. 
            The Lord has combined all of my passions of travel, language, culture, and ministry to continue pursuing missions. 
            I know the Lord is calling me to go serve and use my abilities given through Him and am relying on him for strength and wisdom for raising the financial support. 
            If you would like to hear stories of God working in missions, or have any questions, please reach out.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I have expressed my heart for this trip, I know that I would not be able to go without the spiritual support and financial support of my community. 
            As you feel called, I would be blessed abundantly if you would consider me prayerfully and/or financially. 
            The total cost of the trip is $4,000 which I need to raise by May 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am also seeking prayer partners. 
            These people would be willing to pray for our group’s ministry, safety, health, the people of Colombia and Panama, the people we will be ministering to and possibly sharing the gospel to for the first time, along with the Church’s other mission trips and much more. 
            However you decide to give, your gifts will be used to serve those in need. 
            I cannot thank you enough for being the people that I can trust to guide me along the way! I am thankful for you!
        </p>

        <p>
            With much love and joy, <br>
